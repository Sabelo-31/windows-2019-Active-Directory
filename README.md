<h1>Windws Active Directory</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves setting up a centralized and secure directory service to manage and control user access, resources, and policies within a network. This project includes installing and configuring Windows Server, deploying Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and setting up various roles and features like Domain Controllers, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and user accounts.
